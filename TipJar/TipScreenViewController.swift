    From the TipScreen View, the user can choose which service to use to give money to a performer and how much to tip. Also it would be nice to leave a note of some kind with the performer of 255 characters or less, but that should be optional. Also optional would be to return some kind of 'karma' back to the Tipper to gameify the process.
