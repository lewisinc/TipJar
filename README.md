    The main goal of this project is to provide performers with a tool to connect with their audience members (and vice-versa) in an intuitive and hopefully profitable manner. Through a proximity-based broadcast, using Bluetooth Low Energy technology, performers will be able to connect nearby spectators to their preferred Social Media as well as receive financial donations.

    Within this project there are two smaller products that work in tandem:
	1. TipJar.app
	    + This is the iOS Application that both performer and spectator will use.
	2. TipJar Server
	    + Written in Javascript and running on top of NodeJS, this component will confirm the identities of performers to users prior to them being presented to the user so as to prevent fraudulent broadcasts.

    In addition to the product itself, it will be necessary to use and implement several 3rd Party API's to provide the 'Tipping' functionality of the app.
