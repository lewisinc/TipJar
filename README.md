    The main goal of this project is to provide performers with a tool to connect with their audience members (and vice-versa) in an intuitive and hopefully profitable manner. Through a proximity-based broadcast, using Bluetooth Low Energy technology, performers will be able to connect nearby spectators to their preferred Social Media as well as receive financial donations.
